# Runite's Tibia Calculators

Welcome to Runite's Tibia Calculators, a set of calculators designed to help you determine various stats and metrics for your character in the game Tibia. With these calculators, you can determine your base damage, expected damage, expected healing, and time to level.

## Features

As of 3/23/2023, the following calculators are available:

- Base Damage: Calculate your base damage for melee attacks.
- Expected Damage: Calculate your expected damage for melee attacks.
- Expected Magic Damage: Calculate your expected damage for magic attacks.
- Time to level your magic to the next level: Calculate the time it will take to level your magic to the next level.


## Usage

# Expected Magic Damage Calculator

When using the calculator for expected magic damage, follow the prompts. When asked for the spell name, use the normal english  name of the spell, e.g. "Fire Wave"

For Strike Spells, since they all use the same formulae just input "Strike Spells"


To use the calculators, simply input the relevant information into the provided fields and click "Calculate." The calculator will then output the result. 

## Future Development

I will be adding in elemental resistances and other features in the future. 

I will be constantly working to improve and expand the Runite's Tibia Calculators set. In the future, we plan to add additional calculators for healing, speed, and more. 

Thank you for using Runite's Tibia Calculators!
