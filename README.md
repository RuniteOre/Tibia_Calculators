# Runite's Tibia Calculators

Welcome to Runite's Tibia Calculators, a set of calculators designed to help you determine various stats and metrics for your character in the game Tibia. With these calculators, you can determine your base damage, expected damage, speed, and more. 

## Features

As of 3/23/2023, the following calculators are available:

- Base Damage: Calculate your base damage for melee attacks.
- Expected Damage: Calculate your expected damage for melee attacks.

Please note that at this time, the Expected Damage calculator is only available for melee attacks. 

## Usage

To use the calculators, simply input the relevant information into the provided fields and click "Calculate." The calculator will then output the result. 

## Future Development
I will be constantly working to improve and expand the Runite's Tibia Calculators set. In the future, we plan to add additional calculators for healing, speed, and more. 

Thank you for using Runite's Tibia Calculators!
